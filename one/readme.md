- A local university has asked you to create an HTML document that allows potential students to provide feedback about their campus visit. Your HTML document should contain a form with text boxes for a name, address and e-mail. Provide check boxes that allow prospective students to indicate what they liked most about the campus. These check boxes should include: students, location, campus, atmosphere, dorm rooms and sports. Also, provide radio buttons that ask the prospective student how they became interested in the university. Options should include: friends, television, Internet and other. In addition, provide a text area for additional comments, a submit button and a reset button.
